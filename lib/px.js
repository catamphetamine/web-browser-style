/**
 * Rounds the amount of pixels with a sensible precision and appends `"px"` at the end.
 * Example: `123.456789` â†’ `"123.457px"`. The rationale for rounding is that no screen
 * could resolve up to a 10,000th fraction of a pixel, and for the time being resolving
 * up to a 1,000th franction of a pixel seems more than enough.
 *
 * This function could be used for less clutter in debugging and also for dealing with
 * really big or really small numbers which could end up converted to a string using
 * "exponential" format as `"1.2345e-50"`, and when a web browser receives such a weird value
 * for a pixels amount, it considers it invalid.
 *
 * And if such an "invalid" pixels amount is used as part of a "complex" CSS property
 * like `box-shadow` then the whole such property gets discarded.
 *
 * @param {number}
 * @return {string}
